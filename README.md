# bicycle_EDA_project
This is the complete documentation of codes I used while analyzing the data of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd's bicycles sales. 
I used Python (especially Pandas library) as tech stack, while Google Colaboratory as IDE.
This code include the process of:
  1. Push the file of the data set (CSV)
  2. Understanding general properties in the data set, such as columns, rows, and total of rows with null-value data
  3. Data cleaning 
  4. Exploratory data analysis
